Google Interview tips
Google Technical Interviews:
-takes on gmeet.

-Coding
-Algo
-System Design

-More exp, more knowledge expected.

-DSA
-NPE complete problems - like traveling salesman and knapsack, similar ones.
-Arrays, Hashtable, LL, Graphs, Trees, Stacks, Priority Queues.
-Quantitative skills - Elementary probability skills, Combinatorics, N choose K.
-Graph algos - for Distance, Search, Connectivity, Cycle Detection.
-3 ways to represent graphs- Object and ptrs, Matrix, Adjacency list.
Also know its pros and cons.
Basic graph traversal algo -
BFS , DFS, Computational complexity, Tradeoffs, How to implement.

Recursion-
-Prepare for recursion and dynamic programming.
-Coding design
-Sorting and trees
-APIs
-Big O Notations

Familiarize with System Design.

Knowledge + Theory + Judgement + Experience.


Interfaces, Distributed Systems, Limitations, Robustness, Consider tradeoffs.

-How internet works as a whole.

-OS - Processes, Threads, Concurrency issues, Locks, Mutexes, Semaphores, Monitors, Deadlocks and livelock, Resources, Context switching.

Key approach

Explain thought process and clarify answers.
Verbalize and check your assumptions. 
After providing solution, think to improve.
**Jumping directly to brute force not recommended, take time and come up with a efficient solution.

-Google Doc (no IDE)

-Coding Que-
-Efficient coding solution in time.

Focus:
-Coding - how to test 
-Familiar with common data structures - and Space and time complexity.

Testing-
How will we unit test the code and test cases.
