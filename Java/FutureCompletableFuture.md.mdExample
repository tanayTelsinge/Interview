Synchronous - main thread blocked.

Async way:
- Callable - if u want to return value
- Runnable - no value just execute
- This values are catched in Future.


= But in future, get() is blocking, i.e. main thread will wait here.

= Completablefuture, normally non blocking, but if u use get() or join() blocking there.
- Main adv, chaining, exception handling using exceptionally.
