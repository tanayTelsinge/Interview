#### Recursion can be solved by multiple approaches:
1. IBH (Induction - Base - Hypothesis) -> check for nearest case. (for print 1 - N, height of tree etc.)
   - check what are ip - op
   - Hypothesis decide - what will function do? check for smaller input.
   - Base - what will be base condition.
   - Induction - core logic.
3. Recursion tree (for subset, subsequences etc)

# ðŸŒ³ Recursive Patterns with Tricks

## â”œâ”€â”€ 1. Linear Recursion
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Aggregation & Summation**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For problems like sum, product, or counting elements, use **tail recursion** to optimize space complexity (eliminating the need for additional stack frames).
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Calculate the sum of an array.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Convert the problem to a helper function that carries an additional accumulator (e.g., `acc`) to avoid recomputing intermediate values.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Sequential Traversal**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: If you're traversing an array or linked list recursively, break down the problem by processing one element at a time and then moving forward. For better space complexity, use an iterative approach if recursion depth is too large.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Reverse a linked list.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Use the recursive call as the point to swap the next element with the current one, reducing complexity.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Single-path Search**
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: Implement **early termination** if the base case is found before reaching the end. This helps save time when searching for an element in an array.
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Linear Search.
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: When searching for an element, use a condition to immediately return when the element is found to avoid unnecessary recursion.

## â”œâ”€â”€ 2. Tree Recursion
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Fibonacci-like Problems**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: Use **memoization** to store previously computed values in a hash table to avoid redundant calculations.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Fibonacci sequence.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Instead of recomputing each Fibonacci number from scratch, store the results in a dictionary or array, and look them up as needed.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Combinations & Subsets**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: Use a **backtracking** approach to build subsets or combinations incrementally. **Prune** the search space early if conditions are violated (e.g., the sum exceeds a target).
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Generate all subsets of a set.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Leverage the fact that for each element, you either include it or exclude it, and recursively solve the problem for the next element.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Recursive Decision Trees**
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For **binary decision problems**, reduce the problem space by splitting it into two or more smaller subproblems at each step (e.g., in the knapsack problem, try to include or exclude an item).
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Coin change problem.
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Use dynamic programming (memoization or tabulation) in addition to recursion to keep track of already solved subproblems and improve efficiency.

## â”œâ”€â”€ 3. Divide and Conquer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Sorting**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: In **Merge Sort** or **Quick Sort**, the partition step (splitting the array) is key. Ensure that the pivot or midpoint is chosen wisely to minimize the number of recursive calls.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Merge Sort.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: For Quick Sort, choose a **random pivot** to avoid worst-case time complexity (O(n^2)) when the input is sorted or nearly sorted.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Searching**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: **Binary Search** is efficient for sorted arrays. Always ensure the array is sorted before applying binary search, or implement **exponential search** when the size of the array is unknown.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Binary Search.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: If the array is not sorted, you can use **quick sort** or **merge sort** to sort it first.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Matrix & Tree Decomposition**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For **Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication**, break the matrix down into smaller subproblems and solve recursively to get a better time complexity (O(n^log7)).
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Matrix Multiplication.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: For tree balancing, recursively balance left and right subtrees to maintain an O(log n) height.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Divide for Optimization**
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For problems like finding the **closest pair of points**, break the points down into smaller subsets, find the closest pairs recursively, and combine the results.
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Closest Pair of Points.
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: When combining results, ensure that you only compare points within a specific distance to avoid unnecessary checks.

## â”œâ”€â”€ 4. Backtracking
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Permutations & Combinations**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: When generating **permutations** or **combinations**, try to **prune** the search tree when itâ€™s clear that a path will not lead to a valid solution (e.g., if the sum exceeds the target).
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Generate all permutations.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Use **lexicographical order** to generate permutations more efficiently.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For problems like the **N-Queens**, apply constraints early to eliminate invalid choices (e.g., avoid placing a queen in a column thatâ€™s already occupied).
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Solve N-Queens.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Use **backtracking** with **pruning** to explore possible configurations and **terminate early** when you find an invalid solution.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Subset & Combination Sum Problems**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: Use **pruning** in combination sum problems to skip over paths that are not promising (e.g., when the sum exceeds the target).
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Combination Sum.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Sort the input array to improve performance by allowing you to stop early when the current sum exceeds the target.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Optimization Problems**
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: When solving optimization problems (e.g., knapsack), consider whether you need to use **memoization** to store intermediate solutions and avoid redundant computation.
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Knapsack problem.
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Solve by recursively choosing to include or exclude an item while maintaining a running total of the value and weight.

## â”œâ”€â”€ 5. Recursive Search (DFS)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Graph Traversal (DFS)**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: When implementing **DFS**, use a **visited set** to avoid revisiting nodes. For large graphs, consider using **iterative DFS** to avoid stack overflow.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: DFS Traversal.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Use **stack** or **queue** data structures explicitly in your implementation for better control.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Grid Traversal & Region Problems**
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: In problems like **Flood Fill**, store visited cells in a separate data structure to prevent revisiting them. Consider **memoization** if the problem has overlapping subproblems.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Number of Islands.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Use **DFS** or **BFS** to find all connected components or regions.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Backtracking for Search**
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For problems like **word search**, ensure that you only continue if the current path can form a valid word (use a **prefix tree (Trie)** to optimize).
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Word Search.
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Prune paths early if the current word cannot be completed.

## â””â”€â”€ 6. Memoized Recursion (Top-down DP)
    â”œâ”€â”€ **Fibonacci-like Problems**
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For **Fibonacci** and other sequence problems, store previously computed values to avoid recomputing them. Use a dictionary or array for efficient lookups.
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Fibonacci sequence.
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: If using a bottom-up approach, fill a DP table iteratively to avoid excessive recursion depth.
    â”œâ”€â”€ **Knapsack-like Problems**
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For **knapsack problems**, build a DP table where each cell represents the optimal solution for a subproblem. This avoids recalculating the same subproblems.
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: 0/1 Knapsack.
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: Use **iterative DP** to optimize memory usage (usually 2D DP can be reduced to 1D).
    â”œâ”€â”€ **Grid-based Problems**
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: Use a **memoization table** to store results of subproblems in problems like finding unique paths in a grid.
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Unique Paths in a Grid.
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: For grid-based DP problems, use the **tabulation** technique for bottom-up computation to avoid deep recursion.
    â”œâ”€â”€ **Subset & Partition Problems**
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: Use a **bitmask** to represent subsets efficiently in DP problems.
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ **Work Problem**: Subset Sum Problem.
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **Tip**: For partition problems, try dividing the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved with smaller states.
    â””â”€â”€ **String Problems**
        â”œâ”€â”€ **Trick**: For string problems like **Edit Distance**, use a **2D table** (DP table) to store intermediate results.
