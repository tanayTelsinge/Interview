## Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand**
   - Read problem carefully
   - Identify constraints
   - Write test cases

2. **Plan**
   - Think of brute force
   - Identify patterns
   - Consider optimizations

3. **Implement**
   - Write clean code
   - Use meaningful names
   - Handle edge cases

4. **Test**
   - Dry run code
   - Test edge cases
   - Analyze complexity
